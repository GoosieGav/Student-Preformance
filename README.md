This is a linear regression model that predicts student preformance based on previous data.

From the dataset, I chose certain features that would be more benefical towards the accuracy of the model. It uses features such as former grades, study time, and absences.

The model's data can also be plotted for every feature.

Here are some examples:

As you can see, some features provide more linear shapes than others.
