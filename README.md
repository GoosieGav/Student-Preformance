This is a linear regression model that predicts student preformance based on previous data.

This repo contains two versions of the code, one using multiple features thus having higher accuracy, but not it is not graphable. The other version just uses a single feature meaning it can be graphed, but it has lower accuracy.

Both of the models use sklearn linear regression, and they come from UC Irvine's dataset on student grades. https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/320/student+performance

Above is the plotted linear regression model fitted to the one-feature data.
